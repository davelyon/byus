# this.isby.us

_Simple link sharing for small groups_

## What does it do?

Creates ad-hoc link bins that can be shared with others via a secret link.

## What does this solve?

Know some people with similar interests?  Do you often send them links via email, twitter, or other sources?  Instead of tossing link wherever, whenever, and hoping your friends see them, why not keep a singular location where you and your friends will gather links?

Here's a personal example: I share links with friends via an IRC channel.  Sometimes, I'm not in the channel, or the server crashes, or any number of things happen, and sometimes I miss the links my friends post.  If they put them in a bin via this.isby.us, then I won't miss anything!

## Why are you doing this?

I'm currently building this application as an Apprentice at [Hashrocket Chicago](http://hashrocket.com/ "Hashrocket").
